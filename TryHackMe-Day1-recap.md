## What was easy:
- Understanding the difference between offensive and defensive security roles.
- Completing hands-on exercises with clear instructions.

## What was tricky:
- Remembering all the possible roles and responsibilities in the cyber industry.
- Some technical terms in defensive security (like SIEM, DFIR) are still new to me – need more practice.

## What I learned:
- Offensive = "attackers" (ethical hackers, pentesters), Defensive = "defenders" (analysts, responders, blue team).
- Both areas are equally important and work together to protect organizations.
- There are many career paths in cybersecurity – it's worth trying both offensive and defensive labs to see what fits me best.
