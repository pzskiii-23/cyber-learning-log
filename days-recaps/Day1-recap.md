# Day 1 Recap

- Set up GitHub portfolio repository
- Installed Ubuntu Server VM in VirtualBox
- Practiced basic Linux terminal commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `ls -l`, `rm`, `rmdir`)
- Created my first VM snapshot (backup)
- Updated the virtual machine using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- Tested network connectivity and explored SSH connection (connection issue noted â€“ to be fixed later)
- Started learning Python basics: working with loops, functions, and simple string manipulations.

**What was easy:**  
Setting up GitHub and running basic terminal commands.

**What was tricky:**  
Initial Ubuntu installation took longer due to unattended install errors. Also, SSH connection from host failed in NAT mode (will configure later).

**What I learned:**  
How to create and manage a VM, use basic Linux commands, update the system, and handle typical permission and network issues in a lab environment.
