# TryHackMe – Networking Essentials (Recap)

- Completed several interactive tasks on network basics (LAN, routing, switches, topologies).
- Learned the difference between bus and star topology in terms of cost and complexity.
- Practiced subnetting basics: subnet masks, bit lengths, octet range, and address types.
- Explored ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
- Understood how MAC and IP addresses work together on a network.
- Learned the basic DHCP packet sequence: Discover, Request, Ack.

**What was easy:**
- Identifying the roles of routers, switches, and gateways.
- Answering questions about address types and topologies.

**What was tricky:**
- Understanding subnet mask bit ranges and their roles in network segmentation.

**What I learned:**
- The structure and terminology of computer networks, including LAN, routing, subnetting, ARP, and DHCP.
- How data is transmitted, addressed, and routed on both local and larger networks.
- The real-world function of network devices (switch, router, gateway) and logical vs. physical addresses.

**What I want to do next:**
- Explore how attackers can abuse ARP/DHCP (e.g., spoofing) in real labs.

**Example key facts:**
- LAN: Local Area Network
- Routers perform routing, switches connect devices
- Bus topology: cost-efficient, Star: more expensive but robust
- Subnetting divides a network into smaller pieces (32 bits in IPv4 mask)
- MAC = physical address, IP = logical address
- ARP: Address Resolution Protocol, matches IP ↔ MAC
- DHCP: assigns IPs automatically (discover, request, ack)
